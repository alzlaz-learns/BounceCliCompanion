This is the companion to the BounceMessage android app. It acts as a desktop server that lets the user write a message through the command send <target phone number> <message> and it send a notification over an active websocket
connectionand then when a connection is open to send it to the android app. I used this an opportunity to try out how the Eclipse Vert.x toolkit works.
